    <p>COMMENTS: Hi Lynn - thanks for sending me the white tea towels  appreciated :)
We would like to have to above order delivered for this Friday the 6th of January.
Also - we would like to get  a refund for the 5 bags that were taken back by your truck driver over the last few months. i had a chat to him and he said he wrote the name "Saltwater" on the bags with the stained new sheets that we could not use.
As it will be unclear how many sheets and pillow cases we returned, and to be fair on both - I would settle for 25 king sheets.
Let me know what you think, Thanks Lynn</p>
