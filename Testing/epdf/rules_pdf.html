										<h4>Set-Up and Breakdown Times</h4>
										Sponsor will be assigned a set-up time based on the day(s) that Sponsor is scheduled to participate in the Festival. Due to the nature of the Festival, its location and the logistical issues involved in making the Festival a great success for sponsors and the general public, it is imperative that Sponsor comply with all scheduled arrival times. A breakdown time will also be assigned and must be strictly adhered to.
									<h4>Vehicles and Parking</h4>
										Sponsor must remove all vehicles from the site immediately after unloading. There is no on-site parking available, in view of the Grand Tasting Village's beach front location.
								<h4>Butane Burners and Fire Safety</h4>
										For Sponsor's safety and the safety of the general public, Sponsor will be permitted to use tabletop butane burners. No propane or compressed gases will be permitted on the venue or under the tent tops. Sponsor must maintain on-site a readily accessible fire extinguisher available at all times. If Sponsor is unable to provide your own fire extinguisher, you will be required to purchase one from the Festival for $100. Please note: Any fabric used for decorative purposes must be fire retardant.
								<h4>Water and Ice</h4>
										Two 5-gallon water jugs will be available upon request only, per day. There is no running water on-site.  100 lbs of ice is also available upon request.  There will be a charge if additional ice or water is required.
									<h4>Cold Storage</h4>
											Festival will supply a limited amount of cold storage via on-site refrigerated trucks. Sponsor must notify its sponsor fulfillment representative in advance if Sponsor plans to use space in the cold storage.
									<h4>Cookware and Food Service Ware</h4>
										Festival will not supply any utensils needed for food preparation or service (i.e. spatulas, chef knives, cookware, etc.).
